TIKI THEMES

A number of visual themes (also known as skins or templates) are distributed with Tiki but more are available, and you can
create an original theme or adapt an existing theme made for plain HTML or for another platform such as WordPress (respecting licence restrictions) for your own purpose.
The bundled themes can serve as models of how themes work in Tiki.

Tiki's themes (stylesheets and associated files) are in the "themes" directory in the root directory of the Tiki installation.
If a new theme has only a stylesheet (CSS file), then only a "css" sub-directory is needed in the theme's directory.
The path to the theme stylesheet is, for example, "themes/mynewtheme/css/mynewtheme.css".
Only the directories that actually contain content are necessary. For example, if your theme uses custom fonts that are locally stored,
there needs to be a "fonts" directory within the new theme's directory to contain these fonts.

Please refer to the "Default" theme (themes/default/) or the "FiveAlive" theme (themes/fivealive/) folders to see the standard file system
organization and content for themes.
